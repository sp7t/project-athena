## Background & Motivation

The current recruiting process is largely manual, relying on referrals or reviewing resumes submitted through job boards like LinkedIn. As the company grows, this process lacks the structure, consistency, and scalability needed to support efficient hiring at scale. While tools like ChatGPT can offer ad-hoc assistance, they are not reusable, trackable, or integrated into any consistent workflow.

**Project Athena** addresses these gaps by offering an intelligent, internally owned hiring assistant that supports key parts of the hiring workflow. From job description creation to resume analysis and candidate ranking, the tool augments decision-making for recruiters and hiring managers.
