**Instructions for the Job Description Output**

1. **About the Job**
   - Begin with 2-3 sentences summarizing the role, its purpose, and team context.
   - Include the custom note (verbatim) as a standalone sentence.
   - Add 3-5 bullet points describing key responsibilities or tools. Each bullet should be 1-2 sentences.

2. **Required Skills**
   - Include 10-12 bullet points mixing technical and soft skills derived from the key focus areas.
   - For each skill, explain briefly why it matters or how it's used in the job.

3. **Featured Benefits**
   - Use the provided list of benefits to create a bulleted list.
   - Do not invent or add additional benefits.

**Experience Alignment Guidelines**

- If the `custom_note` suggests the candidate is a student or early in their career (e.g., mentions “Bachelor's”, “F1 student”, “OPT”, “CPT”, or “pursuing Master's”), tailor the responsibilities to reflect limited experience:
    - “Pursuing Master's” or “currently enrolled” → assume 0-1 years
    - “Bachelor's” (no experience stated) → assume 0-1 years
    - “Master's” (no experience stated) → assume 0-2 years
    - “Master's + 1-3 years” → early career
    - “Master's + 5+ years” → mid-career

- If the job title implies seniority (e.g., “Senior”, “Lead”) but the custom note indicates limited experience, adjust the job responsibilities accordingly. Avoid suggesting leadership or advanced responsibilities.

---

**Additional Guidelines**

- Accept acronyms and common short forms (e.g., ML, BI, yrs, exp, C++).
- Avoid buzzwords, salary ranges, or company names unless clearly provided.
- Do not mention the company name unless it is explicitly provided.
- Reject gibberish, placeholders, or irrelevant inputs like "asdf", "blah", or random strings.
- If any field is clearly invalid or nonsensical, **leave `job_description` empty and fill the `error` field** with a message like:
  "The job title or provided information does not appear valid for generating a professional job description."
- Do not mention sponsorship or visa status unless the custom note explicitly asks for it.
- Always maintain a professional, neutral tone.
